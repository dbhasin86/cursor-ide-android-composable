# Android Guidelines

- **First launch / project setup:** If the user asks for "first launch setup" or "project setup", use the skill **Android/Kotlin first-launch setup** (android-kotlin-first-launch-setup).

- Use Kotlin for all new development in this project.
- Prefer Jetpack Compose over XML views
- Use Material 3 components
- Structure: data → domain → ui (presentation)
- Use Hilt for DI, ViewModel + StateFlow / Compose State
- Coroutines + Flow for async
- Never suggest deprecated APIs (e.g. no LiveData unless legacy)
- Follow official Android naming & architecture guidelines
- When generating UI: use @Composable, remember, collectAsStateWithLifecycle, etc.
- Follow [Android Design Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/develop#core-areas) as documented on the Android Developers website.
- Prioritize using Room for database operations over raw SQLite where possible.
- Ensure all code is well-commented and follows the existing architectural patterns.
